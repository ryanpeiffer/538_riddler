# 538_riddler
My attempts at solving 538 riddler puzzles!

This is one fun way I practice my R skills. I try to create simulation approaches to solving the probability-based riddlers posted by fivethirtyeight.com.

A lot of my code is quite sloppy and suboptimal (read:long run times!). I would love suggestions on how to make it better! Each solution I try to write something that can run 1 million simulations in a reasonable amount of a time (couple minutes).

File naming convention: name of file is the date the 538 riddler was posted. Files may contain only the "Riddler Express", "Riddler Classic", or both within one script. Typically I'll copy the prompt into the R script so it's clear to understand what's going on.
