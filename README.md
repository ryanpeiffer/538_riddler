# 538_riddler
My attempts at solving 538 riddler puzzles!

This is one fun way I practice my R skills. I try to create simulation approaches to solving the probability-based riddlers posted by fivethirtyeight.com.

A lot of my code is quite sloppy and suboptimal (read:long run times!). I would love suggestions on how to make it better!

File naming convention: name of file is the date the 538 riddler was posted. Files may contain only the "Riddler Express", "Riddler Classic", or both within one script.


CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
- Understanding how to 'vectorize' solutions better (I get stuck in 'loop' thinking too often)
- Mixing up data.frame, data.table, or tidy/dplyr approaches for manipulating data
