# 538_riddler
My attempts at solving 538 riddler puzzles!

This is one fun way I try to practice my R skills. I try to create simulation approaches to solving the probability-based riddlers posed.

A lot of my code is quite sloppy and suboptimal (read:long run times!). I would love suggestions on how to make it better!

File naming convention: name of file is the date the 538 riddler was posted. Files may contain only the "Riddler Express", "Riddler Classic", or both within one script.
